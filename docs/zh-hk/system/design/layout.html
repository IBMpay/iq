<h1>頁面設計</h1>
<p>此功能為 OpenCart 特色之一，將系統上已啟用的模組插件加到合適的位置上，使網店更有特色風格。如果未了解模組的安裝及使用可參閱<a href="zh-hk/extension/installer/">安裝插件</a>。</p>

<p>OpenCart 預設了以下頁面：</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Account</td>
    <td width="*">Affiliate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Category</td>
    <td>Checkout</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Contact</td>
    <td>Default</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Home</td>
    <td>Information</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Manufacturer</td>
    <td>Product</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sitemap</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If you haven&#39;t done so already, you should take some time to <a href="zh-hk/store-front/">browse the store front</a>. To become familiar with layouts available in OpenCart, you should visit the different page types of your store front. The Manufacturer page layout has a different type of layout than the Checkout page, which has a different page layout than the Information page, and so on. It&#39;s good to see how these layouts arrange themselves, to discover how positioning a module from the Extensions section will affect the overall look of the page.</p>
<p>Creating a layout page from scratch takes some knowledge of web design and development. Once a layout page has been created, you should upload the files with an FTP client.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/catalog_view_theme_default_template.png" alt="template files" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>The location of the layout pages in the default theme is visible under /catalog/view/theme/default/template/ in the OpenCart directory. You can see that all the page layouts from the default are included as folders above. To add a new layout page, you would need to upload the files under a new layout folder.</p>
<p>After the new layout page is uploaded to the location above, it can added to the store by clicking the &quot;Insert&quot; button under System &gt; Design &gt; Layout. The new layout will require a layout name, the store the layout will be added to, and a route. The route is the folder name that the layout files are included in. OpenCart knows to search for the folder under /catalog/view/theme/default/template/ in the store directory, so only the folder name is required.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/system-design-layout.png" alt="design layout page" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>Clicking &quot;Add Route&quot;, then &quot;Save&quot; will make the new layout available in the store. See <a href="zh-hk/extension/module/">Modules </a>for more information on how to add a module to a specific layout page.</p>
